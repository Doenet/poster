\begin{sectionblock}{The Problem to Solve}
  Finding online mathematics resources is not difficult.
  But finding readily available resources field-tested in a variety of
  settings and known to be high quality is a challenge.

  \vspace{1ex}CuratedCourses addresses this challenge by curating
  instructional materials (like textbook content, videos, interactive
  applets, and instructor guides) and by identifying best practices
  for curating comprehensive quality-controlled libraries of
  instructional materials.
