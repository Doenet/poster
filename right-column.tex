  Interactives can be built via DoenetML, an opinionated markup
  language built to encode learner interactions with mathematical
  content.  Starting with primitives like \texttt{<point>}, complex
  interactives can be described and then shared with learners.

\begin{sectionblock}{Doenet API}
  Webpages, whether or not they are written using DoenetML, can use
  the Doenet API to record events.  These events can be analyzed to
  understand how engagement with the webpage affects learning.
