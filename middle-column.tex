\begin{sectionblock}{A Solution}
  This project collects and analyzes student interaction data through
  a distributed educational technology framework weaving together
  authors, instructors, researchers, and learners.

  \vspace{1ex}We call the platform \textbf{the Distributed Open
    Education Network}, or Doenet.  In short, Doenet measures student
  interactions with web pages and stores anonymized data in an open
  and distributed data warehouse.

  We investigate the benefits of virtual manipulatives and the
  influence of the support given to learners as they navigate online
  activities.

  \vspace{1ex}The event log resides in an open data warehouse, so 
  educational researchers can probe the data to generate additional
  knowledge on student learning.
