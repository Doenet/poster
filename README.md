# CuratedCourses poster

To help people understand the project, the team created a poster.

`left-column.tex` and `middle-column.tex` and `right-column.tex`
contain the content in the left, middle, and right column,
respectively.  `poster.tex` is the master file.

The qrcode points to https://curatedcourses.org/ and is generated by
the `Makefile` using qrencode (to produce an svg) and inkscape (to
convert said svg to a pdf that LaTeX can include).
